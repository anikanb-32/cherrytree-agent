  'How the founders met': {
    why: 'I ask because the origin story is the first thing people rewrite later. “We were equals from day one” and “I brought them in” are two different companies, and both versions tend to show up once equity is on the table.',
    typical:
      'College, a job, a hackathon, a friend-of-a-friend — it doesn’t matter which. What matters is whether one of you was already in motion when the other arrived.',
    watch:
      'The version that causes trouble is the one where one founder later says they were the starter and the other was help. If that’s true, say it now. If it isn’t, get it on the record.',
    recommend:
      'Tell it the way you’d tell a friend, not the way you’d tell an investor. Specifics hold up; “we just clicked” doesn’t.',
    ack: reflectMeet,
  },
  'Origin of the idea': {
    why: 'Who brought the idea quietly becomes an equity argument. When one person conceived it and the other joined to build, they almost always remember the split of credit differently a year on.',
    typical:
      'One founder had the insight, or you arrived at it together. Both are fine — the agreement just needs to know which, because it colors IP and how you talk about contribution.',
    watch:
      '“It was both of us” is the answer people give when they haven’t actually agreed. If one of you had the idea first, that’s not a slight. It’s a fact the document can live with.',
    recommend:
      'Be literal. “I had the idea, they made it real” is a stronger foundation than a polite tie.',
    ack: reflectIdea,
  },
  'How the work is divided today': {
    why: 'Roles on paper drift from roles in practice. The agreement should describe the real one, or you’ll be arguing about a job description neither of you is doing.',
    typical:
      'One of you is product or engineering, the other is customer or ops — or you’re both still doing everything. Early on, “everything” is honest; it just shouldn’t stay unnamed.',
    watch:
      'The fight is rarely about titles. It’s about who thought they owned a decision that the other person went and made.',
    recommend:
      'Describe the last two weeks of work, not the org chart you wish you had.',
    ack: reflectWork,
  },
  'Commitment level': {
    why: 'Uneven commitment is the single biggest source of resentment I see. One founder quits their job, the other keeps consulting “for a few more months,” and nobody renegotiates.',
    typical:
      'Both full-time is the clean version. One full-time and one part-time can work if you write down when the second person joins — and what happens to equity if they don’t.',
    watch:
      '“For now” is the phrase that turns into a year. If someone has a date, put the date in. If they don’t, the agreement should say how you’ll revisit it.',
    recommend:
      'If you aren’t both full-time, don’t paper over it. Write the plan, including what the split does if the plan slips.',
    ack: reflectCommit,
  },
  'Business of the company': {
    why: 'The business description is what IP assignment and any non-compete point back to. Too vague and it protects nothing; too narrow and it misses whatever you pivot into.',
    typical:
      'A sentence: who it’s for and what it does. “A tool that helps independent pharmacies manage inventory” is enough. “A revolutionary platform” is not.',
    watch:
      'Founders write poetry here and then can’t tell, six months later, whether a new product is even in scope.',
    recommend:
      'Write it the way you’d explain it to a stranger at dinner. You can always widen it later, together.',
    example: 'Something like: “Software that helps small clinics schedule staff.” One clause. No manifesto.',
    ack: (text) => `I’ll draft it as ${clip(text, 70)}.`,
  },
  'State of incorporation': {
    why: 'This decides whose corporate law governs everything else we’re about to write down — equity, vesting, fiduciary duties.',
    typical:
      'Delaware if you think you’ll raise. California if you’re staying small or bootstrapped and already live there. “Not yet” is fine, but equity and IP can’t really bind anyone until there’s an entity.',
    watch:
      'People incorporate wherever they happen to have an address, then pay to move it when an investor asks. That’s a bill you can avoid.',
    recommend:
      'If you have any path to venture money, start in Delaware. If you don’t, don’t spend the extra just to look like you might.',
    legal:
      'I’m not your lawyer, and this isn’t legal advice. Delaware is the default because investors and case law already know it — not because it’s morally better.',
    ack: reflectEntity,
  },
  'Basis for the split': {
    why: 'This is the section that ends friendships. I’m not going to tell you the number. I want the reasoning written down, because “we agreed it was fair” is not something either of you can point at in two years.',
    typical:
      'Even split is common and signals trust. Contribution-based is fairer on paper and harder to reopen. Leaving it open is fine only if you also say how and by when you’ll decide.',
    watch:
      'The 60/40 that nobody explained. Or the 50/50 that one person later decides was charity. Write the why, not just the fraction.',
    recommend:
      'Pick the split you can defend to each other sober, then write that defense into the document.',
    ack: reflectSplit,
  },
  'Shares on early departure': {
    why: 'A one-year cliff means nothing is owed if someone walks early. For whatever has vested, most agreements also let the company buy those shares back at cost. Without that, a founder who left in month fourteen still owns a piece of everything you build afterward.',
    typical:
      'Unvested shares go back to the company. Vested shares are often subject to a repurchase at the price the founder paid — usually a fraction of a cent.',
    watch:
      'Founders skip this because it feels unkind. The unkind version is the person who left still sitting on the cap table while you raise.',
    recommend:
      'If they leave in year one, they should leave the equity too. That’s what the cliff is for.',
    example:
      '“If a founder leaves before the one-year cliff, their shares return to the company. After that, the company can buy vested shares back at cost.”',
    ack: (text) => `That’s the departure rule I’ll write down: ${clip(text, 64)}.`,
  },
  'Vesting schedule': {
    why: 'Vesting is the mechanism that makes equity track contribution over time. It protects the founder who stays at least as much as it protects the company.',
    typical:
      'Four years, one-year cliff, then monthly. That’s what investors expect and what most templates assume.',
    watch:
      'No cliff looks generous and hands a chunk of the company to someone who leaves in month two. A three-year vest is faster; just know you’re off the default.',
    recommend:
      'Unless you have a specific reason, I’d anchor on four years with a one-year cliff.',
    legal:
      'Vesting doesn’t mean the shares aren’t yours — it means they become irrevocably yours on a schedule. Until then the company can take back what isn’t earned.',
    ack: reflectVest,
  },
  'Acceleration on acquisition': {
    why: 'If you’re acquired holding unvested shares, an acquirer can let you go and keep that equity. Acceleration is the conversation about whether a sale finishes the vest.',
    typical:
      'Double-trigger is the common landing spot: vesting accelerates only if you’re acquired and then pushed out. Single-trigger vests everything the moment the deal closes, which acquirers dislike because they’re paying to keep the team.',
    watch:
      'Founders skip this and find out in diligence that leaving after a sale costs them the unvested half of their company.',
    recommend:
      'Double-trigger, unless you have a reason to want everything vested at close. Single-trigger is a harder sell to a buyer.',
    example:
      'Single-trigger: the vest finishes when the deal closes. Double-trigger: it finishes only if you’re also fired or constructively dismissed afterward.',
    ack: reflectAccel,
  },
  'Decisions requiring unanimity': {
    why: 'This is who can decide what alone. Require unanimity on too much and you deadlock over expense reports. On too little and one of you can make an irreversible call by yourself.',
    typical:
      'The usual both-must-agree list is raising money, selling the company, taking on debt, changing the equity split, and firing a cofounder.',
    watch:
      'Putting “hires” or “product direction” on the unanimous list sounds aligned and then freezes the company. Those can be consult-then-decide.',
    recommend:
      'Start with the irreversible ones — money in, company out, debt, equity, and removing a founder. Add more only if you both already fight about them.',
    example:
      'A tight list: issuing stock, taking a loan, selling or merging, changing founder equity, and terminating a founder.',
    ack: (text) => `Unanimous, then: ${clip(text, 72)}.`,
  },
  'Deadlock resolution': {
    why: 'You will disagree on one of the unanimous items. The process has to exist before you need it. Agreeing on a tiebreaker while you’re already stuck is close to impossible.',
    typical:
      'A named outside advisor is the usual first step. CEO-decides is faster and more honest about power. A coin flip is neutral and settles nothing about who was right.',
    watch:
      '“We’ll figure it out” is the most common answer, and the one I’d push back on. Mid-argument is the worst time to invent a court.',
    recommend:
      'Name a person you both already trust. You almost never call them. Their job is to make the rest of the argument behave.',
    ack: reflectDeadlock,
  },
  'IP assignment': {
    why: 'Unassigned IP is one of the most common things that stalls a fundraise or an acquisition once diligence starts. “Yes” without paperwork doesn’t survive that.',
    typical:
      'Everything built for the company gets assigned to the company, in writing, including work from before you incorporated if it was for this idea.',
    watch:
      'A founder’s old employer, or a contractor who never signed an assignment, can own a piece of what you think is yours.',
    recommend:
      'If it isn’t in writing, treat it as not done. This is the cleanup you want finished before you raise or sell.',
    legal:
      'Assignment has to be in writing. A conversation, a Slack, or “of course it’s the company’s” is not an assignment.',
    ack: reflectIP,
  },
  'Pre-existing IP': {
    why: 'Work from before the company isn’t automatically the company’s — not even if you built it for this idea, not even if you were the only one who touched it. It needs a formal assignment, or an explicit license if you want to keep personal ownership.',
    typical:
      'Assign what was built for this company. Keep a short excluded list for personal tools, prior projects, and anything that isn’t the business.',
    watch:
      'The vague “whatever I built before is mine” carve-out is how you accidentally keep the thing the company is. Be specific about what stays personal.',
    recommend:
      'If it exists because of this idea, assign it. If it’s a side library you want to reuse later, name it and license it in.',
    example:
      '“Code and designs made for this product are the company’s. My prior open-source library X is excluded and licensed to the company.”',
